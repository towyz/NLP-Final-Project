But is there an American Cardinal who, if elected Pope, would be a challenge to this Administration in a similar way that John Paul II was to Communism? Obviously the fact that Poland was 90% Catholic made JP2 far more powerful, so it wouldn’t have nearly the same impact. But nonetheless the first American Pope challenging Mango Mussolini would be…. interesting.\n",

It's a take on faith where Jesus is a secondary figure and the main concerns are the nature of the world and their own place in it - specifically their place at the top, or so they desire. Scripture is only useful insofar as how it can grant them power.\n",

The utility of the religion in this form to condition the masses to rule by a divine authority was perfect and the theological inconsistencies with the original message were glossed over in favor of faith in the present teachers, the priests and pastors; so the cognitive dissonance is really at least 1700 years old, if not 2025. \n",

Like all of this really needs to be seen in the context that the church is just off the back of massive child abuse scandals under Benedict and John Paul II that had a massive affect on its influence globally. It's arguable how much direct involvement both individually had, but particularly among young people it has been a primary factor in driving them away. \n",

      "【646】He hasn't only been controversial among Catholics. He's been one of the most progressive popes in a long time after a lot of rather conservative ones, but it's not like he's all steam ahead on reforms and such either. He's said some things that have certainly rubbed non-Catholics the wrong way and I've heard from a few they don't think he's doing much if anything at all to deal with the corruption and pedophilia that's been rampant in the church despite starting his papacy seemingly wanting to. I think it's probably more complicated than that, but I don't know.\n",

      "【829】I wasn't raised religious and am still not religious, but I rather like Pope Francis. He's very vocal about climate change and unfettered capitalism, which I adore. He is still Catholic, so obviously he has many, many beliefs I disagree with, however, he has repeatedly emphasized inclusion and tolerance, which is very sorely lacking in many Catholics. I have known a Catholic family with this attitude, and while I was/am a sinner in a way they certainly don't agree with, they truly did love me and treated me with kindness at a time in my life I felt worthless. I credit a large part of why I'm doing well now to them.\n",

Back in the day the church saw the godless communists as the bigger threat and preferred the fascists to contain them. Today the Baptist churches prefer the felon that pays prostitutes hush money because he's willing to push their agenda.\n",

So if you have a church which for decades has preachers that take a certain stance, then that's what people will believe. And anyone who doesn't is likely to leave and find a different church that conforms better to their beliefs. So whether your area has the crazy people or the normal people is really just luck of the draw probably, combined with some historical factors influencing what kind of message people are susceptible to\n",

      "【985】Religion and the Nazis is interesting. The Nazis were really big on trying to start their own religion and dabbled a lot in neo-paganism because they wanted to go back to what they believed to be their nomadic roots. However the pope did buddy up to Mussolini who at one point was on the side of the Nazis so as a result the church did turn a blind eye to a lot of what was going on because of politics and power. That said, it's well documented that a lot of Catholic Priests were critical of the Nazis and the Nazis killed a lot of clergymen; mostly Polish. It's a bit of a minefield but the Catholic Church has always been political and tends to get led in the direction the current pope takes it in. Their role in WW2 was wishy washy as they attempted to stay in line with the morals of the church whilst remaining in favour of powerful dictators. People still argue to this day about what happened, whether they played a part in facilitating Hitler and if they did enough to stop it.\n",

      "If your argument is \"Not All Nazis\" like it's some type of gotcha against what I was saying, I got some news for you... I guess we can say the Nazis didn't hate Jewish people because not 100% of them did, and some of the hatred against all the different groups they prosecuted was to shore up power by targeting minority groups to rally the masses against and not from specific religious hatred. At a certain point you've lost the plot by focusing on nuance. Trying to deflect from the fact that the MAGA crowd ends up having a hilarious amount of easily identifiable similarities to the Nazis that it could be a comedy sketch seems like a weird stance to take. Especially if you're as educated as you say.\n",

There’s a reason why the Widow’s Offering is often brought up by churches, completely out of that context, as a good story around the time that they solicit donations.
